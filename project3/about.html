    rini tran is a vietnamese digital artist based in the bay area who has been creating original characters & anime style
    illustrations since 2015. inspired by her childhood experiences, tran's works evoke nostalgia with soft pastels and
    whimsical mascots. she loves designing & collecting stickers and sees them as the perfect medium for expressing a
    feeling or telling a story.
    <h2>​🇸​​🇹​​🇦​​🇹​​🇪​​🇲​​🇪​​🇳​​🇹​</h2>
    my works are meant to evoke childhood nostalgia and remind the viewer of a time when life was simpler. i'd like you to
    remember the days when you'd come home from school and play outside for hours without thinking about the worries and
    obligations of adulthood. for me, art is an escape from the monotony of daily routine and a reminder that growing up
    doesn't mean we have to abandon the things we love. i hope my works speak to your inner child and bring back happy
    memories!
