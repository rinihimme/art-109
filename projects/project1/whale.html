    <h1>BLUE WHALE</h1>

    <body>
    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    Whales roam throughout all of the world's oceans, communicating with complex and mysterious sounds. Their sheer size
    amazes us: the blue whale can reach lengths of more than 100 feet and weigh up to 200 tonsâ€”as much as 33 elephants. Despite living in the water, whales breathe air. And like humans, they are warm-blooded mammals who nurse their young. A
    thick layer of fat called blubber insulates them from cold ocean waters. Some whales are known as baleen whales, including blue, right, bowhead, sei, and gray whales. This refers to the fact
    that they have special bristle-like structures in their mouths (called baleen) that strain food from the water. Other
    whales, such as beluga or sperm whales, have teeth.

    <br><br>Whales are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall health of the marine environment.
    Whales play a significant role in capturing carbon from the atmosphere; each great whale sequesters an estimated 33 tons
    of CO2 on average, thus playing their part in the fight against climate change. Unfortunately, their large size and mythical aura does not protect them; six out of the 13 great whale species are
    classified as endangered or vulnerable, even after decades of protection. An estimated minimum of 300,000 whales and
    dolphins are killed each year as a result of fisheries bycatch, while others succumb to a myriad of threats including
    shipping and habitat loss.

    <br><br><h3>ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS</h3>
    Despite a moratorium on commercial whaling and a ban on international trade of whale products, three countriesâ€”Iceland,
    Japan, and Norwayâ€”continue their commercial whale hunts. Over 1,000 whales a year are killed for such commercial
    purposes. The blue whale, the largest animal ever known to have existed, was almost exterminated in the 20th century due
    to commercial whaling. The United States and other International Whaling Commission (IWC) member countries have tried for years to persuade
    Iceland, Japan, and Norway to end their whaling as it undermines the effectiveness of the commission's commercial
    whaling ban. However, in 2019, Japan chose to walk away from the IWC and now conducts commercial whaling in its own
    territorial waters, outside of any international controls.
    
    <br><br>Warming oceans and loss of sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic can affect the habitats and food of whales. Large patches
    of tiny plants and animals that they feed on will likely move or change in abundance as climate change alters seawater
    temperature, winds, and ocean currents. These changes can mean whales such as humpbacks and blues may have to migrate
    much further to reach feeding grounds, leaving them with less time to forage for food. The shift in food availability
    due to climate fluctuations has already hurt the reproductive rates of the endangered North Atlantic right whale.
